Hi, I’m **Sam Goldmann** — a software engineer with a deep focus on **software architecture**, **infrastructure**, and the systems that tie them together.

I specialize in:

* **Software architecture and system design**
* **Distributed microservices** and event-driven systems
* **Cloud-native platforms** built with ASP.NET Core and Azure
* **DevOps automation** using Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and Docker
* **Secure authentication flows** in multi-tenant environments
* **Developer experience tooling**, from CI pipelines to intelligent agents

My technical work blends structured engineering with a human-centered approach. I believe good architecture is not just scalable — it's understandable, maintainable, and ethical.

### What You'll Find Here

This blog is a space where I share:

* Practical solutions to real-world engineering challenges
* Patterns for resilient distributed systems and API design
* Explorations of automation, testing strategies, and release workflows
* Reflections on how engineering intersects with ethics, parenting, and growth

But more than that, it's also a journal of personal growth. Much of my evolution as a technologist has been shaped by my experiences as a **father**, and by working through **grief, reflection, and change**. This is a space where I try to honor the complexity of building systems and raising children, both of which require patience, clarity, and the courage to learn from mistakes.

### Beyond the Code

I’m a father, a systems thinker, and someone who believes that the way we build matters as much as what we build. I've grown immensely through loss — and through rebuilding. My engineering principles are deeply connected to my values as a parent and as a person who strives to move forward with integrity.

This blog reflects both the technical disciplines I practice — and the lived experiences that continue to shape who I am.

Let’s build something worthwhile.
